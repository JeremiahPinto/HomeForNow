# HomeForNow

## Context

This application will digitalise the youth crisis accommodation sector.
Making the process:

* less stressful
* simpler
* easier
* more efficient, reducing costs

### How we are going to do this:

A simple responsive web application that allows a homeless youth to easily search for available accommodation and then be able to quickly make a booking. Accommodation providers are provided with a simple interface to enter, modify and track their bed vacancies with a platform to receive accommodation enquiries.
